<h2>DEFINE</h2>

<p>The cat is a domestic species of small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat" target="_blank" title="cat specification">carnivorous mammal</a>. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family</p>

<p>A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.</p>
